# A little blog

This may turn into a blog site but for now it is the skeleton of one.

What it needs:
- [x] RSS Feed
- [x] Website design
    + [x] Home page design
    + [x] Blog post cards
    + [x] Blogs posts on the home page
    + [x] Fun error page
- [x] Content lol
- [x] move over book reviews
- [x] move over post for advent of code
- [x] excerpts
- [x] code highlighting
- [x] asset hosting
- [x] github action build
- [x] hosting in github pages
- [ ] port to main blog
- [ ] rss link in footer
- [ ] Resume Section
- [ ] icon
- [ ] cool auto navigation hamburger
- [ ] pagination of blog posts?
- [ ] hosting in some other way

It may ultimately be ported to my [current blog](https://ajone239.github.io).

# Svelte

This was made with Svelte and was heavily influenced by [this post](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog) by [Josh Collinsworth](https://joshcollinsworth.com/about-me).
## Developing

Once you've pulled the project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
